# Functionality Details

##### The script should support piping all files of below interpreted languages:

* [x] Python (2.x, 3.x) - `py` (for Python .py extension files. Needed for *nix systems)
* [x] Perl (Version Independent) - `plc`, `pld`, `pl` (for Perl .pl, .plc, .pld extension files)
* [x] PHP (Version Independent) - `php` (for .php extension files)
* [x] Ruby (Version Independent) - `rb` (for Ruby .rb extension files)
* [x] Node.js (Version Independent) - `js` (for Node.js .js extension files)


##### The script should support piping all proxies of above languages and following:

* [x] Jsp (With Tomcat, or any webserver as proxy)
* [x] Aspx (With IIS, Apache, or any webserver as proxy)
* [] Jsp (With Tomcat embedded) [TODO]
* [] Aspx (With Nginx and Apache embedded) [TODO]


##### The script currently allows working with (starting, stopping, restarting) following web servers:

* [x] IIS (Allows Proxy)
* [x] Nginx (Allows Proxy)
* [x] Nginx (Allows Embed)
* [x] Apache HTTPD (Allows Proxy)
* [x] Apache HTTPD (Allows Embed)
* [x] Apache TomCat (Allows Proxy)
* [] Apache TomCat (Allows Embed) [TODO]
* [] Mongoose (Allows Proxy) [PLANNED]
* [] Mongoose (Allows Embed) [PLANNED]
* [] Jetty (Allows Proxy) [PLANNED]
* [] Jetty (Allows Embed) [PLANNED]
* [] Putty (Allows Proxy) [PLANNED]
* [] Putty (Allows Embed) [PLANNED]
* [x] Other Proxy-able local/remote servers


##### The script currently allows working with (starting, stopping, restarting) following databases and processes:

* [x] Mysql
* [x] MongoDB
* [] PgSQL [TODO]
* [] Redis [TODO]
* [x] Other Processes for your application support


##### TODO ITEMS

Add:
- [*] CGI File serving [Done]
- [*] Proxy local and remote web servers [Done]
- [*] Proxy supporting websockets [Done]
- [*] Manual commands [Done]
- [*] Command line options for all interpretors in config object [Done]
- [*] Work with any executables/processes [Done]
- [*] Work with embedding Servers (HTTPD, Tomcat[todo], Nginx) [Partially done]
- [*] Work with embedding Database Servers (MySQL, PgSQL[todo], MongoDB) [Partially done]
- [*] Work with other using generic command process functions and executables [Partially done]
- [] Consider support for gRPC, UDP/Other Protocols for proxy. Consider adding socket's module [TODO]
- [] Improve performance by reducing config parsing time. Consider singletons for non-dynamic configs [TODO]
- [] Move cgi file serving to be based on processes execute implementation keeping current method of cgi.serve implementation same [TODO]
- [] Add implementation of phpcgijs into cgijs - cgi.serve(filename, executable, args) without moving current method of implementation [TODO]
- [] Deprecate phpcgijs in favour of cgijs [TODO]
- [] Consider testing serving of js file as CGI executable like PHP, an option. Considering cgi-node as an option [TODO]
- [] Consider adding serving CGI file (.cgi) like PHP, an option [TODO]
- [] Consider adding tracer for errors. Reconsider error handling mechanism [TODO]


Modify:
- [*] Make config and options dynamic based on config file for file based demos [Done]
- [*] Config based serving for file, web (proxy) applications [Done]
- [*] Add 'other' or 'custom' CGI executable option for unaccomodated Interpreted language support [Done]
    - [*] IMPORTANT: Remove multiple libraries for httpserver and fix one [Done]
- [] Tests for Production release version 1.0.0 - file module [Partially done]
- [*] Tests for Production release version 1.0.0 - process module [Partially done]
- [*] Tests for Production release version 1.0.0 - proxy module [Partially done]
- [*] Tests for Production release version 1.0.0 - utils module [Partially done]
- [] Check and Redo Authentication for proxy connections for VLAN proxies [TODO]
- [] Consider adding inbuilt development server management (testing needed) for CGI executables like PHP, Ruby, Python, others [Testing]

High Priority, Low Effort:
